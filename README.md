# ParisSubway

Finding the shortest path between Paris metro stations (using the Dijkstra algorithm with improvements)

The Paris metro is represented as a graph in the file input.txt
The first line of the file says order and size of graph. Then, before the '$' line, the number of the vertex and its name are written. After the $, a pair of connected vertices and the edge weight are written.

The project was made in collaboration with KRETTLY Garance, Brijesh Mallisseri Poduvanda
